# Budget-A-Tron

Budget-A-Tron is a simple way to visualise financial data (via QIF file import).

## Why

Budget-A-Tron exists for two main reasons:

1. As an addition to my personal [portfolio](http://www.jmiles.me/portfolios)
2. A way for me to keep an eye on my own finances

## Competitors

Why not just use Mint/Pocketsmith/Pocketbook/etc

I'm sure those services do a fine job, but here's a list of items in favour of Budget-A-Tron:

* Free for unlimited accounts and open source (GPLv3)
* Not limited to particular country/region
* No access to your personal bank account (only manual imports)

## Technologies

Pretty standard rails stack:

* Rails 5
* RSpec
* Bootstrap 4
